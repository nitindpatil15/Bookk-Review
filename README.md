# 📚 Book Review API

A full-featured backend API built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, allowing users to sign up, log in, manage books, submit reviews, and perform filtered searches. Authentication is handled using **JWT**, and data is stored in a **MongoDB** database.

## 🔧 Requirements

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (or compatible database)
- JWT for authentication
- Postman (for testing endpoints, optional)

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- Backend: **Node.js**, **Express.js**
- Database: **MongoDB** with **Mongoose**
